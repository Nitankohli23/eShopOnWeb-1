# Please write some Automated Tests!

I am going to do End to end and functionality testing as I am focusing on how different components and
functions work together to deliver a complete user experience. I am basically testing the software
from start to finish, which involves multiple functions and interactions.

I used selenium, webdriver manager, cucumber, cucumber-junit.

How to run the test: You have to navigate to CukesRunner class and specify the tags which means the scenario that you would
like to run in the feature file and then run the test.
